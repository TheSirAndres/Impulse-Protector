# Impulse Protector (Portfolio Project) 🚗💡
![Project Banner](sources/icons/purple_transparent_thunder.png)

> [!important]  
> **Impulse Protector** is an online vehicle insurance quote generator, developed as a practice project under the fictional corporation **Impulse**.  
> **Phase 1 fully completed**: Functional, responsive interface and quote system ready for use.

---

## Key Features ✨

### Real-Time Quote Generator
- **Brand, Model & Year**: Choose from multiple brands, models, and years (last 20 years dynamically calculated).
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Cost calculated based on brand, year, model, and insurance type (basic, premium, full).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, responsive design for mobile and desktop.

### Planned Features 🔮
> [!note]  
> These features are in planning and **not yet implemented**.
- **User Registration**: Profiles to save vehicles and quotes.
- **Continue Payment**: Integrated payment flow.
- **Quote History**: Quick access to previous quotes.

---

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Flexbox/Grid), Vanilla JavaScript.
- **Architecture**: Prototypes and Object Constructors (for data and logic structuring).
- **Compatibility**: Responsive design tested on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

> [!tip]  
> The project uses **legacy object-oriented programming** to deepen core JS concepts.  
> Future plans? Migrate to ES6 classes once core concepts are mastered.
